# doppler_BCO
Analysis of Doppler radar data at the Barbados Cloud Observatory:
- Visualization of Doppler spectra and moments.
- Drop Size Distribution (DSD) retrieval from dual-frequency doppler spectra observations from the Ka-band and W-band radars (Tridon and Battaglia, 2015)

To visualize radar data (spectra and moments) in a video format within a period of time of your choice:
  1. Create an environment using the `environment.yml` file.
  2. Adjust the configuration file `config.yaml`
  3. Run `/plotting/plot_mbr2.py`, for example.
